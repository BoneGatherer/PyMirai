This is my efforts of reverse-engineering the Mirai botnet source code into Python. It's been two years since the original launch of the botnet and since that time I have yet to see anyone attempt to completely reverse engineer it outside of making it modified in it's native C and Go programming languages.

My reasons for reversing it into Python is simple

1. To improve it's adaptability in countering cybersecurity measures (by out-adapting the efforts of software engineers)
2. To add the function of "modulettes" that can be installed to further expand the original source code's capabilities
